# real human bean

![example workflow](https://github.com/masonalan/real-human-bean/actions/workflows/release.yml/badge.svg)

*real human bean* is an audio plugin that applies humanized offsets to a stream of samples, making the samples sound as
if a person played them. It is ideal for channels that contain one drum part, such as a hi hat channel, snare channel,
etc.

The math behind why these offsets mimic human drum playing is described in [this
paper](https://researchportal.helsinki.fi/en/persons/saara-loviisa-malila) by Saara Malila.
