## real human bean

An audio plugin that applies humanized offsets to a stream of samples. Ideal for using on programmed drums. I'm not
responsible for any lost sessions due to crashes as this plugin is still in development, and admittedly it is my first
plugin.

You can download the VST3 from the releases page or build it yourself if you want an AU or something else.

If you have any bugs or issues please report them! Thanks :)

The plugin is based off of this super cool paper: https://researchportal.helsinki.fi/en/persons/saara-loviisa-malila
